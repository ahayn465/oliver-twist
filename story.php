			<p class='story-item'>People often ask where we got our name from. Well, for those of you who aren’t martini drinkers,
				when you order a classic martini, it is served with either an olive or twist. But don’t worry,
				if you’re not a martini drinker there is still plenty for you to enjoy. (Minors are welcome,
				though we do not have high chairs or a children’s menu.)</p>
